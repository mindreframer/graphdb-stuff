To run this example, make sure you have installed JRuby (easiest with RVM) and 
have installed bundler (gem install bundler).


To run some examples from the wiki, type
  bundle
  ruby simple.rb

There is also other script for adding person nodes and finding them.
  ruby add.rb <name> <salary>
  ruby find.rb <key> <value>

And to list all nodes in the system
  ruby all.rb
