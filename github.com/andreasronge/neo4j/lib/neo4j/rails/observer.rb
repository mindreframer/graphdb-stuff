module Neo4j
  module Rails
    # Observer classes respond to life cycle callbacks to implement trigger-like
    # behavior outside the original class. This is a great way to reduce the
    # clutter that normally comes when the model class is burdened with
    # functionality that doesn't pertain to the core responsibility of the
    # class. Neo4j's observers work similar to ActiveRecord's. Example:
    #
    #   class CommentObserver < Neo4j::Rails::Observer
    #     def after_save(comment)
    #       Notifications.comment(
    #         "admin@do.com", "New comment was posted", comment
    #       ).deliver
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # This Observer sends an email when a Comment#save is finished.
    #
    #   class ContactObserver < Neo4j::Rails::Observer
    #     def after_create(contact)
    #       contact.logger.info('New contact added!')
    #     end
    #
    #     def after_destroy(contact)
    #       contact.logger.warn("Contact with an id of #{contact.id} was destroyed!")
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # This Observer uses logger to log when specific callbacks are triggered.
    #
    # == Observing a class that can't be inferred
    #
    # Observers will by default be mapped to the class with which they share a
    # name. So CommentObserver will be tied to observing Comment,
    # ProductManagerObserver to ProductManager, and so on. If you want to
    # name your observer differently than the class you're interested in
    # observing, you can use the Observer.observe class method which takes
    # either the concrete class (Product) or a symbol for that class (:product):
    #
    #   class AuditObserver < Neo4j::Rails::Observer
    #     observe :account
    #
    #     def after_update(account)
    #       AuditTrail.new(account, "UPDATED")
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # If the audit observer needs to watch more than one kind of object,
    # this can be specified with multiple arguments:
    #
    #   class AuditObserver < Neo4j::Rails::Observer
    #     observe :account, :balance
    #
    #     def after_update(record)
    #       AuditTrail.new(record, "UPDATED")
    #     end
    #   end
    #
    # The AuditObserver will now act on both updates to Account and Balance
    # by treating them both as records.
    #
    # == Available callback methods
    #
    # * before_validation
    # * after_validation
    # * before_create
    # * around_create
    # * after_create
    # * before_update
    # * around_update
    # * after_update
    # * before_save
    # * around_save
    # * after_save
    # * before_destroy
    # * around_destroy
    # * after_destroy

    # == Storing Observers in Rails
    #
    # If you're using Neo4j within Rails, observer classes are usually stored
    # in +app/models+ with the naming convention of +app/models/audit_observer.rb+.
    #
    # == Configuration
    #
    # In order to activate an observer, list it in the +config.neo4j.observers+
    # configuration setting in your +config/application.rb+ file.
    #
    #   config.neo4j.observers = [:comment_observer, :signup_observer]
    #
    # Observers will not be invoked unless you define them in your
    # application configuration.
    #
    # During testing you may want (and probably should) to disable all the observers.
    # Most of the time you don't want any kind of emails to be sent when creating objects.
    # This should improve the speed of your tests and isolate the models and observer logic.
    #
    # For example, the following will disable the observers in RSpec:
    #
    #   config.before(:each) { Neo4j::Rails::Observer.disable_observers }
    #
    # But if you do want to run a particular observer(s) as part of the test,
    # you can temporarily enable it:
    #
    #   Neo4j::Rails::Observer.with_observers(:user_recorder, :account_observer) do
    #     # Any code here will work with observers enabled
    #   end
    #
    # == Loading
    #
    # Observers register themselves with the model class that they observe,
    # since it is the class that notifies them of events when they occur.
    # As a side-effect, when an observer is loaded, its corresponding model
    # class is loaded.
    #
    # Observers are loaded after the application initializers, so that
    # observed models can make use of extensions. If by any chance you are
    # using observed models in the initialization, you can
    # still load their observers by calling +ModelObserver.instance+ before.
    # Observers are singletons and that call instantiates and registers them.
    class Observer < ActiveModel::Observer

      # Instantiate the new observer. Will add all child observers as well.
      #
      # @example Instantiate the observer.
      #   Neo4j::Rails::Observer.new
      def initialize
        super and observed_descendants.each { |klass| add_observer!(klass) }
